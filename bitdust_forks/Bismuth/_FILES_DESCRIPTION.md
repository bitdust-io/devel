# Bismuth REPO files description

This repo will likely go through some refactoring, but in the mean time here is an alphabetic list of all .py files of the main dir, so you know where to look.

Each file maybe a *module* (library of functions, to be included but not run) or a *script* (to be run).

See also the most useful files: https://github.com/EggPool/Bismuth/blob/patch-51/_MOST_USEFUL_FILES.md
Some files have been moved to https://github.com/hclivess/BismuthProjects

## aliases.py (*module*)
Handles the aliases index (ie: labels for bismuth addresses)

## apihandler.py (*module*)
Class to handle extra API commands, that are not part of the core nodes protocol.

## apidirs.py (*module*)

## balance_nogui.py (*script*)

## bisurl.py (*module*)
bisurl encoding and decoding functions.  
A bisurl is a single string that encodes recipient, amount, data and a checksum into a single url like string, to be used in the wallet.  
Exchanges could use this feature to give each user a bis url for deposit. The bis url would include the required custom data field, and the user would only have to adjust the required amount.
