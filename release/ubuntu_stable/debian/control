Description: Distributed backup utility.
 BitDust is a peer-to-peer online backup utility.
 .
 This is a distributed network for backup data storage.
 Each participant of the network provides a portion of his hard drive
 for other users.
 In exchange, he is able to store his data on other users's machines.
 .
 The redundancy in backups makes it so if someone loses your data,
 you can reconstruct what was lost and give it to someone else to hold.
 And all of this happens without you having to do a thing.
 .
 All data is encrypted before it leaves your computer
 with a key your computer generates. No one else can read your data.
 Recover data is only one way - download the necessary pieces
 from computers of other users and decrypt them with your private key.
 .
 BitDust - is written in Python using Twisted.
