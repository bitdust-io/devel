.PP
Imagine that you need the

to keep the contents of a folder on your hard drive and be sure that
.B only you have access
to this data.
.PP
We propose to divide the data into blocks, compress, encrypt and store them on the computers of
.B other users.
.PP
The system is designed in such a way that will keep track of each user which stores your information,

This is very similar to the well-known torrents ... but on the contrary!
