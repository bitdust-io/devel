class State(object):
    """
    Represents some state data that gets kept up to date with the tip of the
    blockchain as new blocks come in. In Bitcoin, this might be used to hold the
    currently unspent outputs.

    Can return a copy of itself, and update with a block forwards, or a block
    backwards. Because we can run history both forwards and backwards, we can
    easily calculate the state at any block by walking a path from the tip of
    the longest branch.

    A State can be packed up for transmission over the network into a series of
    components. Components can depend on each other in a DAG. When the state
    changes, only log(n) components need to be updated, so it's possible to
    download components from a node that has a state that's constantly changing
    and still make meaningful progress. Every State exposes a means to get
    components.

    Responsible for persisting itself to and from a file. It should load from
    the file on construction, and save to the file on commit().

    Also responsible for producing StateMachine instances that can be used to
    update it.

    Ought to be replaced by implementations that actually keep state and make
    copies.
