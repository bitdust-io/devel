    Represents a transaction on the blockchain.

    A transaction is a list of inputs (represented by transaction hash, output
    index), a list of outputs (represented by amounts and destination public key
    hash), and a list of authorizations (public key, signature) signing the
    previous two lists. It also has a timestamp, so that two generation
    transactions to the same destination address won't have the same hash. (If
    you send two block rewards to the same address, make sure to use different
    timestamps!)

    Everything except public keys are hashed sha512 (64 bytes). Public keys are
    hashed sha256 (32 bytes).

    A transaction is properly authorized if all of the inputs referred to have
    destination hashes that match public keys that signed the transaction.

    A generation transaction (or fee collection transaction) is a transaction
    with no inputs. It thus requires no authorizations.

    Any input not sent to an output is used as a transaction fee, and added to
    the block reward.

    Has a to_bytes and a from_bytes like Blocks do.
