    An authenticated dictionary, based on a Merkle Trie, and stored on disk.

    Nodes are identified by pointers (really strings).

    The whole thing is backed by an SQLite database, but has additional
    transaction support. You can make a shallow copy of an
    AuthenticatedDictionary, and insert, find, and delete on it without
    affecting the original or other shallow copies. Copying a shallow copy with
    n changes made is O(N). When you want to save your changes to disk, run
    commit(). After one shallow copy (or the updated original) has been
    comitted, no accesses are allowed to anything that isn't it or a descendant
    of it created after the commit.

    Each chain of an AuthenticatedDictionary and its shallow copy descendants
    must have a unique database filename not shared with any other
    AuthenticatedDictonary chain. It's fine to share it with other things, as
    long as they never sync the database without calling commit on an
    AuthenticatedDictionary first.

    This is how you use it:
