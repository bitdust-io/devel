    Here is a "well known" identity servers to support the network.
    Keys are domain names or global IP address (not recommended) of the ID server.
    Values are ``Web port`` (reading) and ``TCP port`` (writing) numbers.

    This is some kind of "genesis" network.
    If you willing to support the project and started your own BitDust node on reliable machine,
    contact us and we will include your address here.
    So other nodes will be able to use your machine to host their identities.

    You can override those "genesis" nodes by configuring list of your preferred identity servers
    in the program settings:

        api.config_set(
            "services/identity-propagate/known-servers",
            "myfirstserver.net:80:6661, secondmachine.net:8080:6662, thirdnode.gov.eu:80:16661",
        )

    Also check file `default_network.json` in the repository root.

    Both ways you can create your own BitDust network, under your full control.
