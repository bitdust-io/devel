To start you need to fork, then clone the repo:

Deploy and Run BitDust software locally on your machine:

    cd bitdust.devel
    python3 bitdust.py install
    sudo ln -s -f /Users/veselin/.bitdust/bitdust /usr/local/bin/bitdust
    bitdust


Make sure the unit tests pass:

    make test_unit


Run regression tests via Docker:

    make regress_full


Make your change. Add tests for your change. Make the tests pass:

    make

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

Sometimes build is failed, we still have non-stable regression tests, just re-run the failed build in that case.

At this point you're waiting on us, but we will reach you soon to cooperate.

Please attach your PR to one of the [opened issues][issues] so we can keep discussions in correct places.
