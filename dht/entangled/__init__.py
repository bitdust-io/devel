Entangled DHT and distributed tuple space.

The distributed hash table (DHT) used by Entangled is based on Kademlia,
and be accessed by the C{entangled.kademlia package}, or by simply
instantiating/subclassing the exposed C{KademliaNode} in the main C{entangled}
package.

On top of this Kademlia node Entangled provides some extra functionality
in the form of a "C{DELETE}" RPC and keyword-based search operations; these
functions are accessible via the C{EntangledNode} class in the main
C{entangled} package.

The Entangled distributed tuple space is exposed as the
C{DistributedTupleSpacePeer} class, accessible via the main C{entangled}
package or its C{dtuple} module.
