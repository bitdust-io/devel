Entangled - DHT and tuple space based on Kademlia
=================================================

Entangled is a distributed hash table (DHT) based on Kademlia, as well as a
peer-to-peer tuple space implementation. 

This can be used as a base for creating peer-to-peer (P2P) network
applications that require synchronization and event handling (such as
distributed resource provisioning systems) as well as applications that do not
(such as file sharing applications).

Entangled extends basic Kademlia by adding a "DELETE" RPC, allowing (key,
value) pairs to be deleted from the DHT. It also adds some useful higher-level
features onto the base DHT:
- Keyword-aware operations: allows keyword-based operations (publish, search,
  remove)
- Distributed Tuple Space: a fully distributed, peer-to-peer tuple space
  implementation


Requirements
============

- Python 2.5 or later
- Twisted core

Optional:
- Epydoc (for building API documentation)


How to install this package
===========================

Entangled uses setuptools (http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools)

To install Entangled, do:

$ python setup.py install


To build the Entangled API documentation (this requires Epydoc
- http://epydoc.sourceforge.net):

$ python setup.py build_apidocs
