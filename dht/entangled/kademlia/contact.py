        This override allows the host node to call a method of the remote node
        (i.e. this contact) as if it was a local function.

        For instance, if C{remoteNode} is a instance of C{Contact}, the
        following will result in C{remoteNode}'s C{test()} method to be
        called with argument C{123}::
         remoteNode.test(123)

        Such a RPC method call will return a Deferred, which will callback
        when the contact responds with the result (or an error occurs).
        This happens via this contact's C{_networkProtocol} object (i.e. the
        host Node's C{_protocol} object).
