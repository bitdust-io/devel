 'long_description': '# BitDust\n\n[bitdust.io](https://bitdust.io)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/bitdust-io/devel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/bitdust-io/devel)\n\n\n## About\n\n#### BitDust is a peer-to-peer online backup utility.\n\nThis is a distributed network for backup data storage. Each participant of the network provides a portion of his hard drive for other users. In exchange, he is able to store his data on other peers.\n\nThe redundancy in backup makes it so if someone loses your data, you can rebuild what was lost and give it to someone else to hold. And all of this happens without you having to do a thing - the software keeps your data in safe.\n\nAll your data is encrypted before it leaves your computer with a private key your computer generates. No one else can read your data, even BitDust Team! Recover data is only one way - download the necessary pieces from computers of other peers and decrypt them with your private key.\n\nBitDust is written in Python using pure Twisted framework and published under GNU AGPLv3.\n\n\n#### Current status\n\nCurrent project stage is about to only research opportunities of\nbuilding a holistic eco-system that protects your privacy in the network\nby establishing p2p communications of users and maximize distribution of\ninformation flows in the network.\n\nAt the moment exists a very limited alpha version of the BitDust software.\nWe decided to publish those earlier works to verify/test/share our ideas and experiments with other people.\n\n\n## Install BitDust software\n\n#### Install software dependencies\n\nSeems like in Ubuntu (probably most other distros) you can install all dependencies in that way:\n\n        sudo apt-get install git gcc python-dev python-virtualenv\n\n\nOptionally, you can also install [miniupnpc](http://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/) tool if you want BitDust automatically deal with UPnPc configuration of your network router so it can also accept incomming connections from other nodes.:\n\n        sudo apt-get install miniupnpc\n\n\nOn MacOSX platform you can install requirements in that way:\n\n        brew install git python2\n\n\nAnd use pip to get all required packages:\n\n        pip install --upgrade --user\n        pip install --upgrade pip --user\n        pip install virtualenv --user\n\n\nOn Raspberry PI you will need to install those packages:\n\n        sudo apt-get install git gcc python-dev python-virtualenv libffi-dev libssl-dev\n\n\n\n#### Get BitDust to your local machine\n\nSecond step is to get the BitDust sources. To have a full control over BitDust process running on your local machine you better make a fork of the Public BitDist repository on GitHub at https://github.com/bitdust-io/public and clone it on your local machine:\n\n        git clone https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/<name of BitDust fork>.git bitdust\n\n\nThe software will periodically run `git fetch` and `git rebase` to check for recent commits in the repo. This way we make sure that everyone is running the latest version of the program. Once you made a fork, you will have to update your Fork manually and pull commits from Public BitDust repository if you trust them.\n\nHowever if you just trust BitDust contributors you can simply clone the Public repository directly and software will be up to date with the "official" public code base:\n\n        git clone https://github.com/bitdust-io/public.git bitdust\n\n\n\n#### Building virtual environment\n\nThen you need to build virtual environment with all required Python dependencies, BitDust software will run fully isolated.\n\nSingle command should make it for you, all required files will be generated in `~/.bitdust/venv/` sub-folder:\n\n        cd bitdust\n        python bitdust.py install\n\n\nLast step to make BitDust software ready is to make a short alias in your OS, then you can just type `bitdust` in command line to fast access the program:\n        \n        sudo ln -s -f /home/<user>/.bitdust/bitdust /usr/local/bin/bitdust\n        \n\n\n#### Run BitDust\n\nStart using the software by creating an identity for your device in BitDust network:\n       \n        bitdust id create <some nick name>\n       \n\nI recommend you to create another copy of your Private Key in a safe place to be able to recover your data in the future. You can do it with such command:\n\n        bitdust key copy <nickname>.bitdust.key\n\n\nYour settings and local files are located in that folder: ~/.bitdust\n\nType this command to read more info about BitDust commands:\n\n        bitdust help\n\n\nTo run the software just type:\n\n        bitdust\n        \n\nStart as background process:\n\n        bitdust daemon\n\n\nTo get some more insights or just to know how to start playing with software\nyou can visit [BitDust Commands](https://bitdust.io/commands.html) page. \n\nTo get more info about API methods available go to [BitDust API](https://bitdust.io/api.html) page.\n\n\n\n#### Binary Dependencies\n\nIf you are installing BitDust on Windows platforms, you may require some binary packages already compiled and packaged for Microsoft Windows platforms, you can check following locations and download needed binaries and libraries:\n\n* cygwin: [cygwin.com](https://cygwin.com/install.html)\n* git: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)\n* python 2.7 (python3 is not supported yet): [python.org](http://python.org/download/releases)\n* twisted 11.0 or higher: [twistedmatrix.com](http://twistedmatrix.com)\n* pyasn1: [pyasn1.sourceforge.net](http://pyasn1.sourceforge.net)\n* pyOpenSSL: [launchpad.net/pyopenssl](https://launchpad.net/pyopenssl)\n* pycrypto: [dlitz.net/software/pycrypto](https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/)\n* miniupnpc: [miniupnp.tuxfamily.org](http://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/)\n\n\n## Feedback\n\nYou can contact [BitDust contributors](https://github.com/bitdust-io) on GitHub if you have any questions or ideas.\nWelcome to the future!\n\n',
